# S3

S3 is private by **default**.

## S3 Bucket Policies

- A form of resource policy
- Like identity policies, but attached to a bucket
- Resource perspective permissions
- Allow/Deny same or different accounts
- Allow/Deny Ananymous principals

```json
{
  "Version": "",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "PublicRead",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": ["s3:GetObject"],
      "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::secreatcatproject/*"]
    }
  ]
}
```

_Can deny access if the identity trying to access the bucket isn't using MFA._

- ACLs on objects and bucket
- A sub resource
- Legacy
- Inflexible

| Permission | Bucket                                           | Objects                                                 |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| READ       | Allows grantee to list the objects in the bucket | Allows grantee to read the object data and its metadata |

## Block Public Access

Resource Permissions

## Performance Optimization

Single PUT Upload

- Single data stream to S3
- Stream fails - upload fails
- Requires full restart
- Speed & reliability = limit of 1 stream
- Any upload up to 5GB...

This is unreliable

Multipart Upload

Increases speed and reliability when uploading to S3

- Data is broken up
- Minimum data size 100MB for multipart
- 10,0000 max parts, 5MB -> 5GB
- Last part can be smaller than 5MB
- Parts can fail, and be restarted
- Transfer rate = speeds of all parts

Less risky and reliable

### Accelerated Transfer (Off)

Using Edge locations. Much like an express train

Only really effective if the users internet connection is sub optimal.

## Encryption 101

### Encryption Approaches

Encryption at **Rest**
One entity involved

Encryption in **Transit**
Data is encrypts before sending it out (ie, banking sites)

### Concepts

- Plaintext: can be images and apps, not only text
- Algorithm: Takes plain text, encryption key
- Key: Needed to decrypt
- Ciphertext: Encrypted Data

### Symmetric

### Asymmetric

Better way of transferring encrypted data

### Signing

### Steganography

Hiding encrypted data inside other data

## Key Management Service (KMS)

- Regional and Public Service
- Create, store and manage keys
- Symmetric and Asymmetric keys
- Cryptographic operations (encrypt, decrypt, etc...)
- Keys never leave KMS - Provides FIPS 140-2 (L2)

- CMK - Customer Master Key
- CMK is logical - ID, date, policy, desc & state
- ... backed by physical key material
- Generated or Imported
- CMKs can be used for up to 4KB of data

**Key Concepts**

- CMKs are isolated ot a region and never leave
- AWS Managed or Customer Managed CMKs
- Customer managed keys are more configurable
- CMKs support rotation
- Backing Key (and previous backing keys)
- Aliases

### Key Policies and Security

- Key policies (Resource)
- Every CMK has one!
- Key Policies + IAM Policies
