# Starting Strength

A place where Users can save their workout data (targeted towards programs like Starting Strength)

A basic workflow:

1. User logs in to app via mobile app or web browser
2. Creates exercises (or should this be a global uneditable list handled by app owner?)
3. Create program which would be just a list of exercises and named (Day A, Day B, etc)
4. Select day from calendar (or automatically set to today) and select program
5. Display will show list of exercises under that particular program.
6. User will then enter the tonnage of the exercises.
   -- If users have history of the exercise, the app will show a expected value
7. Once the values are entered, the user can save the program.
8. Once the user has data, they can start viewing graphs that will visualize the progress (by exercise, total tonnage etc).
